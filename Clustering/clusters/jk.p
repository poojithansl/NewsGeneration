aVyou are a single guy looking for a rented flat in you would have had your share of struggles with landlords turning you away because'guys are rowdy loud and a nuisance to neighbours's youngsters are not deterred by such'character assassination they have their own ways to ensure they get into the good books of the landlord and strike a deal with the broker looking for accommodation in the city are convincing their female friends and colleagues to pose as their wife or fiance so that they can get a flat in posh societies's a win-win situation for both guys and girls who stay together posing as a couple the guys do n't have to bhatko anymore and the girls have a guy roomie to run errands and take care of their safety without the hang-ups of a boyfriend's a look at's'convenience roomies the guys this puts an end to the long list of rejections from landlords due to their bachelor status who lives with a female friend in says thought'd move in with my girlfriend but we had only been dating for a month and felt it was too early for that moved in with an office friend we do have to pretend to be a couple but thankfully now have a flat in a posh area in the city you'll be frowned upon if you say that you are a bachelor just go'ladkon ko ghar nai dena they are a nuisance was sick of this generalization and asked my colleague to help it works for both of us say they feel safer living with male roommates who come in handy when it comes to running errands or dealing with plumbers or electricians a management trainee says a city like safety is a big concern the two months that have been living with a guy realized that it is safer and much more convenient roommie does all the laborious tasks like moving the furniture and whenever there is an issue with the wiring or plumbing he talks to the technicians deal with the maid and keep a check on the grocery this without the hang-ups of a boyfriend you have to put up with your guy's tantrums and annoying habits a friend roomie everything is much more organized do it all maintaining the facade of being in a relationship involves a lot of hard work say the'couples a journalist says had a professional photographer do a photo shoot with my roommate and me kind of like a pre-wedding shoot have those pictures in the living room so that when the landlord visits it looks like the house of a married couple parents know that live with a female friend but they do n't know about this'fake marriage stuff whenever they come over the pictures are hidden who lives in says have been living with a guy friend for six months now we could n't find a flat when we told the brokers we are just friends we had to pose as a married couple to convince the landlord we host a'family dinner where we call over friends pretending to be cousins and uncles every month the roadblocks do not end after getting the accommodation's fake couples say that the problems persist in the form of nosy parents and jealous girlfriends an consultant says share a flat with a female colleague in had told the landlord that we are engaged to be married because nobody was willing to rent an apartment to bachelors the issue now is that my parents want to visit and stay over at our place'm trying to figure out how to navigate that and how to stop them from talking to the landlord who is sharing a flat with a college friend says the flat was n't very difficult but the problems began with my roommate's girlfriend was a little sceptical about her boyfriend living with another girl and that too pretending to be a couple today she lands up unannounced to check on us visits us so much that we had to tell the landlord that she is my sister landlords say that guys do not maintain the place and sooner or later neighbours begin complaining about loud music and late-night parties do n't create a ruckus a broker says are hard to handle as tenants do n't maintain the house well and you ca n't really go and fight with them every time they are late in paying rent do n't care if the landlord creates a scene's not the case with girls though feel it's better to rent out a house to couples because they are more responsible fact many times we do n't enquire if a couple is married or just living together matters is that they look decent a property dealer says's a general perception that girls are tidier and more particular about giving rent on time as compared to guys landlords avoid giving their flats to single guys case of couples such problems never occur lot of youngsters come to us asking for a flat claiming they are married but'm sure there are several who are n't actually couples landlords do n't ask for a marriage certificate as long as the couple comes across as decent if they do n't get complaints from other residents in the society they do n't go around snooping on the tenants who has let out two of his apartments to couples says are supposed to give their documents including their proof and salary statement when they take an apartment for rent we do n't crosscheck whether a couple is actually married or not baad as long as the rent is on time why should we ask if they are pretending or are genuinely a couple do n't interfere in their personal lives as long they do n't create any nuisance more stories follow us on and

this year after homicides in all of than other cities have also reported increases in violence from a year ago people had been killed by late compared with during the same period a year earlier homicides had hit up from at the same point in the toll was compared with people a year ago in people had been killed this year a percent rise from the murders the city had by the same time last year enforcement experts say disparate factors are at play in different cities though no one is claiming to know for sure why murder rates are climbing officials say intense national scrutiny of the use of force by the police has made officers less aggressive and emboldened criminals though many experts dispute that theory among organized street gangs often over drug turf and the availability of guns are cited as major factors in some cities including more commonly many top police officials say they are seeing a growing willingness among disenchanted young men in poor neighborhoods to use violence to settle ordinary disputes one's status and credibility and honor if you will within that peer community is literally a matter of life and death's police chief said that's coupled with a very harsh reality which is the mental calculation of those who live in that strata that it is more dangerous to get caught without their gun than to get caught with their gun results have often been devastating a mother of five has lost two of her nearly grown children in apparently unrelated shootings in the last eight months a daughter was shot to death during a robbery at a birthday party at a months later the authorities called again only son had been shot in the head in a car a killing for which the police are still searching for a motive and a suspect said she recently persuaded her remaining teenage daughters to move away from with her but not before one of them was wounded in a shooting while riding in a car violence was nothing like this before said who grew up in's changed is the streets and the laws and the parents's become a mess and a struggle bloodshed as well as the overall violent crime rate remains far below the peaks of the late 1980s and early'90s and criminologists

percent to through from a year earlier in are up about percent over the same period a year ago police superintendent in said he thought an abundance of guns was a major factor in his city's homicide spike as officials in both parties are calling for reducing the prison population he insisted that gun offenders should face stiffer penalties the country we've all found it's not the individual who never committed a crime before suddenly killing somebody said on's the repeat offenders's the same people over and over again some experts and rank-and-file officers the notion that less aggressive policing has emboldened criminals known as the effect in some circles is a popular theory for the uptick in violence equilibrium has changed between police and offenders said a professor and a criminologist at doubt the theory or say data has not emerged to prove it a criminologist from the of said homicides in for instance had already begun an arc upward in before a white police officer killed an unarmed teenager in nearby data he said suggests that other factors may be in play debated is the sense among police officials that more young people are settling their disputes including one started on with guns a homicide commander in the cited killings there that had grown out of arguments over girlfriends food and even characters on a show remarkable is that individuals get so upset over things that or others might consider petty but resort to such a level of violence he said the police superintendent said the city's rise in homicides did not appear to reflect any increase in gang violence or robberies of strangers but rather involved killings inside homes and cars by people who know their victims particularly difficult crimes to predict or prevent is not a situation that can be solved by policing said speaks to a culture of violence deeply ingrained into a community a segment of the population where people are resolving their problems in a violent way there have been a larger number of gang-related killings the department's top spokesman said he also said many homicides remained unexplained the result of disputes with murky origins are a lot of murders that
